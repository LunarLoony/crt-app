# Welcome to CRT!
CRT is a minimalist program for organising (and playing) your digital game collection.

# What's it for?
CRT is a desktop app for managing your games. It's designed for use with emulators, but it can be used for any game (or app) as long as it runs on your computer!

It gives you total control on how your games run, how they're organised, and how they're presented. Games can be sorted and filtered in a variety of methods, and its straightforward design means you can get to playing your games sooner rather than later.

# How's it made?
CRT was built with Electron, Node.js, and some good old-fashioned HTML and CSS. To build it yourself, you'll need to install Node.js and Electron first.

# Usage
Check the 'Releases' section if you want to try CRT out early! The app is made to be easy to navigate, but further documentation will be coming soon(tm).

# Why CRT?
Most retro games were played on CRTs, and since this app is aimed at emulation, it seemed appropriate!
